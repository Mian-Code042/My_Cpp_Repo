# 📘 C++ and OOP Practice Programs – 2nd Semester

Welcome to my collection of **C++** programs developed during my **2nd semester of Computer Science**. This repository includes a wide range of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) tasks, basic to advanced C++ concepts, constructor exercises, inheritance, pointers, virtual functions, and real-world logic-based implementations.

## 📂 Folder Contents

This repository contains the following types of programs:

### 🔹 Core C++ Concepts
- Input/Output Handling
- Conditional Statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)
- Functions (parameterized, default, return types)

### 🔹 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes and Objects
- Constructors (Default, Parameterized, Copy)
- Destructor Usage
- Inheritance (Single, Multilevel, Hierarchical)
- Function Overloading & Operator Overloading
- Pointers and `this` Pointer
- Virtual Functions and Polymorphism

### 🔹 Real-world Problem Solving
- Stock Trading System
- Library Management System
- Milk Addition Program
- Student Information Handling
- Bank Account Simulation
- Time & Date Calculations
- Sales and Tax Calculators

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Use any C++ compiler like:
   - Dev-C++
   - Code::Blocks
   - Visual Studio Code with `g++`
   - OnlineGDB or Replit

2. Example to compile and run (using terminal):
   ```bash
   g++ filename.cpp -o output
   ./output
